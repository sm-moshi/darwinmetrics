darwinmetrics is a Nim library for collecting system metrics on macOS. This guide will help you quickly get up and running with the basics.

Before you begin, ensure you have:

* Nim 2.2.2 or higher
* macOS 12.0+ (Monterey or higher)
* Nimble package manager

## Installation

The simplest way to install darwinmetrics is via Nimble:

```bash
nimble install darwinmetrics
```

Alternatively, you can add it as a dependency in your .nimble file:

```nim
requires "darwinmetrics >= 0.1.0"
```

For more detailed installation instructions, see the [Installation Guide]({% link _docs/installation.md %}).

## Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of using darwinmetrics to fetch system information:

```nim
import darwinmetrics

# Initialize the metrics system
initMetrics()

# Get CPU information
let cpuInfo = getCpuInfo()
echo "CPU Cores: ", cpuInfo.cores
echo "CPU Usage: ", cpuInfo.usage, "%"

# Get memory information
let memInfo = getMemoryInfo()
echo "Total RAM: ", memInfo.totalRam div 1024 div 1024, " MB"
echo "Used RAM: ", memInfo.usedRam div 1024 div 1024, " MB"
echo "Free RAM: ", memInfo.freeRam div 1024 div 1024, " MB"

# Get temperature information
let tempInfo = getTemperature()
echo "CPU Temperature: ", tempInfo.cpuTemp, "Â°C"
echo "Fan Speed: ", tempInfo.fanSpeed, " RPM"

# Clean up
shutdownMetrics()
```
