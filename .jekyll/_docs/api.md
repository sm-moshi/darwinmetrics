## üñ•Ô∏è Core Functions

The DarwinMetrics API is designed to be safe, efficient, and thread-aware. All functions correctly handle memory management, particularly when dealing with Mach kernel interfaces. Thread-safe operations are implemented using locks where appropriate.

### CPU Information

```nim
proc getCpuInfo*(): CpuInfo {.raises: [DarwinError, DarwinVersionError].}
```

Returns detailed CPU information including architecture, cores, frequency, and current usage.
Supports both Apple Silicon and Intel processors.

```nim
proc getCpuUsage*(): CpuUsage {.raises: [DarwinError].}
```

Returns current CPU usage percentages across different states (user, system, idle, nice).

```nim
proc getPerCoreCpuLoadInfo*(): seq[HostCpuLoadInfo] {.raises: [DarwinError].}
```

Returns per-core CPU load information, with user/system/idle/nice tick counts for each CPU core.
Correctly manages memory allocated by Mach kernel functions.

### Load Average Monitoring

```nim
proc getLoadAverageAsync*(): Future[LoadAverage]
```

Asynchronously retrieves current system load averages. Thread-safe.

```nim
proc startLoadMonitoring*(history: LoadHistory, interval: float = 60.0): Future[void]
```

Starts monitoring load averages at the specified interval, storing samples in the provided history.

```nim
proc newLoadHistory*(maxSamples: int = DefaultMaxSamples): LoadHistory
```

Creates a new thread-safe load history tracker with the specified maximum sample size.

```nim
proc add*(history: LoadHistory, load: LoadAverage)
```

Adds a load average sample to the history in a thread-safe manner.

### Memory Statistics

```nim
proc getMemoryInfo*(): MemoryInfo
```

Returns system memory statistics including RAM and swap usage.

### Power Management

```nim
proc getPowerInfo*(): PowerInfo {.raises: [].}
```

Returns comprehensive power and battery information including battery presence, charge level,
power source, charging status, and estimated times for battery operation.

```nim
proc getBatteryPercentage*(): float {.raises: [].}
```

Returns the current battery percentage (0-100). On systems without batteries, returns 0.0.

```nim
proc isPowerAdapterConnected*(): bool {.raises: [].}
```

Checks if the system is connected to an external power source.
Returns true if on AC power, false if on battery.

```nim
proc getRemainingTime*(): Option[int] {.raises: [].}
```

Returns the estimated time remaining in minutes for battery operation.
If the system is on AC power or has no battery, returns None.

```nim
proc getBatteryHealth*(): Option[BatteryHealth] {.raises: [].}
```

Returns battery health information if available, including cycle count, condition, and capacity metrics.

```nim
proc getThermalPressureLevel*(): ThermalPressure {.raises: [].}
```

Returns the current thermal pressure level, indicating if the system is experiencing thermal issues.

### Temperature Sensors

```nim
proc getTemperature*(): TempInfo
```

Returns temperature readings from various system sensors.

### Network Statistics

```nim
proc getNetworkInfo*(): NetworkInfo
```

Returns network interface statistics and traffic information.

### Process Information

```nim
proc getProcessInfo*(pid: int): ProcessInfo
```

Returns detailed information about a specific process.
