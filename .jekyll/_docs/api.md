## üñ•Ô∏è Core Functions

The DarwinMetrics API is designed to be safe, efficient, and thread-aware. All functions correctly handle memory management, particularly when dealing with Mach kernel interfaces. Thread-safe operations are implemented using locks where appropriate.

### CPU Information

```nim
proc getCpuMetrics*(): Future[CpuMetrics] {.async.}
```

Returns detailed CPU metrics for the current system, including architecture, cores, frequency, current usage, and load averages.
Supports both Apple Silicon and Intel processors.

```nim
proc getCpuUsage*(): Future[CpuUsage] {.async.}
```

Returns current CPU usage percentages across different states (user, system, idle, nice).

```nim
proc getPerCoreCpuLoadInfo*(): Future[seq[HostCpuLoadInfo]] {.async.}
```

Returns per-core CPU load information, with user/system/idle/nice tick counts for each CPU core.
Correctly manages memory allocated by Mach kernel functions.

### Load Average Monitoring

```nim
proc getLoadAverage*(): Future[LoadAverage] {.async.}
```

Asynchronously retrieves current system load averages. Thread-safe.

```nim
proc startLoadTracking*(history: LoadHistory, interval = chronos.seconds(60)): Future[void] {.async.}
```

Starts monitoring load averages at the specified interval, storing samples in the provided history.

```nim
proc newLoadHistory*(maxSamples: int = DefaultMaxSamples): LoadHistory
```

Creates a new thread-safe load history tracker with the specified maximum sample size.

```nim
proc add*(history: LoadHistory, load: LoadAverage)
```

Adds a load average sample to the history in a thread-safe manner.

### Memory Statistics

```nim
proc getMemoryMetrics*(): MemoryMetrics {.raises: [ref MemoryError].}
```

Returns system memory statistics including RAM and swap usage.

```nim
proc getProcessMemoryInfo*(): ProcessMemoryInfo {.raises: [ref MemoryError].}
```

Returns memory information for the current process.

```nim
proc getMemoryPressureLevel*(): MemoryPressure {.raises: [].}
```

Returns the current memory pressure level of the system.

### Power Management

```nim
proc getPowerMetrics*(): PowerMetrics {.raises: [].}
```

Returns comprehensive power and battery information including battery presence, charge level,
power source, charging status, and estimated times for battery operation.

```nim
proc getBatteryPercentage*(): float {.raises: [].}
```

Returns the current battery percentage (0-100). On systems without batteries, returns 0.0.

```nim
proc isPowerAdapterConnected*(): bool {.raises: [].}
```

Checks if the system is connected to an external power source.
Returns true if on AC power, false if on battery.

```nim
proc getRemainingTime*(): Option[int] {.raises: [].}
```

Returns the estimated time remaining in minutes for battery operation.
If the system is on AC power or has no battery, returns None.

```nim
proc getBatteryHealth*(): Option[BatteryHealth] {.raises: [].}
```

Returns battery health information if available, including cycle count, condition, and capacity metrics.

```nim
proc getThermalPressureLevel*(): ThermalPressure {.raises: [].}
```

Returns the current thermal pressure level, indicating if the system is experiencing thermal issues.

### Disk Operations

```nim
proc getDiskMetrics*(): Future[DiskMetrics] {.async.}
```

Returns disk usage and performance information for all mounted volumes.

### Network Statistics

```nim
proc getNetworkMetrics*(): Future[NetworkMetrics] {.async.}
```

Returns network interface statistics and traffic information.

### Process Information

```nim
proc getProcessMetrics*(): Future[ProcessMetrics] {.async.}
```

Returns detailed information about processes including resource usage.
