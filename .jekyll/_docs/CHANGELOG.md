## [0.0.6] - 2024-04-01 🧠

### ✨ Added

- Memory management improvements:
  - Implemented public memory API with clean abstraction
  - Added memory pressure level monitoring
  - Added process memory information tracking
  - Added comprehensive memory statistics
  - Added memory unit constants (KB, MB, GB, TB)
  - Added proper error handling and type safety

### 🔄 Changed

- Refactored memory types into separate modules:
  - Moved internal Mach types to `memory_types.nim`
  - Created clean public API in `memory.nim`
  - Improved documentation and examples
- Enhanced error handling in memory operations
- Improved type safety across memory management
- Enhanced CPU module documentation:
  - Added comprehensive examples and usage patterns
  - Improved type descriptions and field documentation
  - Added platform-specific notes for Apple Silicon/Intel
  - Matched documentation style with memory module
  - Added clear separation between low-level and high-level interfaces

## [0.0.5] - 2024-04-01 🚀

### ✨ Added

- CPU frequency detection:
  - Support for Apple Silicon (M1/M2) frequency reporting
  - Intel CPU frequency detection with brand string fallback
  - Flexible frequency tests for cross-architecture support
  - Per-core CPU usage tracking:
  - Added `getPerCoreCpuLoadInfo()` to get per-core load statistics
  - CPU usage tracking with user/system/idle/nice percentages
  - Thread-safe load history monitoring with locks
  - Async load average monitoring interface

### 🔄 Changed

- **BREAKING**: Removed DarwinError from getFrequencyInfo for graceful fallbacks
- Made frequency detection more resilient across architectures
- Enhanced error handling with reasonable defaults for different CPU types
- Memory management in CPU metrics:
  - Corrected vm_deallocate header import from <mach/mach_vm.h> to <mach/vm_map.h>
  - Fixed memory deallocation after retrieving per-core CPU information
  - Properly exported Mach kernel functions for cross-module use
  - Improved import structure for better code organization
- Refactored CPU module to use selective imports
- Enhanced thread safety in load history tracking
- Added proper type annotations for Mach kernel bindings

### 🐛 Fixed

- Memory deallocation for Mach kernel statistics
- Thread safety concerns in CPU metrics module
- Documentation for memory management across Darwin platforms

## [0.0.4] - 2024-04-01 📊
