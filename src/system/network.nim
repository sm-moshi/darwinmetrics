## Network metrics for darwinmetrics.
##
## This module provides types and procedures for gathering network-related metrics
## on macOS systems.

type
  NetworkInfo* = ref object
    ## Information about network usage and performance
    bytesReceived*: int64    ## Total bytes received
    bytesSent*: int64       ## Total bytes sent
    packetsReceived*: int64 ## Total packets received
    packetsSent*: int64     ## Total packets sent
    errors*: int64          ## Number of errors
    drops*: int64           ## Number of dropped packets

## Network metrics module for Darwin
proc getNetworkInfo*(): NetworkInfo =
  ## Returns network usage and performance information
  ## Note: This is a placeholder implementation
