## Disk metrics for darwinmetrics.
##
## This module provides types and procedures for gathering disk-related metrics
## on macOS systems.

type
  DiskInfo* = ref object
    ## Information about disk usage and performance
    totalSpace*: int64        ## Total disk space in bytes
    freeSpace*: int64        ## Free disk space in bytes
    readBytes*: int64        ## Total bytes read since boot
    writeBytes*: int64       ## Total bytes written since boot
    readOps*: int64         ## Number of read operations
    writeOps*: int64        ## Number of write operations

proc getDiskInfo*(): DiskInfo =
  ## Returns disk usage and performance information
  ## Note: This is a placeholder implementation
