## [0.0.5] - 2024-04-01

### Added

- CPU frequency detection:
  - Support for Apple Silicon (M1/M2) frequency reporting
  - Intel CPU frequency detection with brand string fallback
  - Flexible frequency tests for cross-architecture support
  - Per-core CPU usage tracking:
  - Added `getPerCoreCpuLoadInfo()` to get per-core load statistics
  - CPU usage tracking with user/system/idle/nice percentages
  - Thread-safe load history monitoring with locks
  - Async load average monitoring interface

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Removed DarwinError from getFrequencyInfo for graceful fallbacks
- Made frequency detection more resilient across architectures
- Enhanced error handling with reasonable defaults for different CPU types
- Memory management in CPU metrics:
  - Corrected vm_deallocate header import from <mach/mach_vm.h> to <mach/vm_map.h>
  - Fixed memory deallocation after retrieving per-core CPU information
  - Properly exported Mach kernel functions for cross-module use
  - Improved import structure for better code organization
- Refactored CPU module to use selective imports
- Enhanced thread safety in load history tracking
- Added proper type annotations for Mach kernel bindings

## [0.0.4] - 2024-04-01

### Added

- CPU load average monitoring:
  - LoadAverage type with 1/5/15-minute averages

  - Mach kernel statistics integration
  - Timestamp validation and chronological ordering
  - Comprehensive test coverage

### Changed

- Improved test suite reliability

### Fixed

- Deque handling in LoadHistory tests
- Timestamp validation in load average tracking

## [0.0.3] - 2024-04-01
